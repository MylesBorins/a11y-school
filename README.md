###Work in Progress

This will eventually be the repo for an accessibility nodeschool workshopper that individuals can use to learn how to be better at a11y.

####What can we teach:

* Intro to a11y
  - what is a11y

  - alternative forms of user input

* How to use a screen reader

* Making a non accesible page accessible
